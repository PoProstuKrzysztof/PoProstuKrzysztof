### Hi! Nice to have you here ðŸ‘‹

I'm Christopher, and I started my journey with programming since I enrolled on my unversity. It was hard at first, but after a while I have understand that everything can be achieved through hard work and discipline, and this is something crucial especially in coding. This not only had a positive effect on my software developing skills, but also on many other aspects of my life. My spare time is filled with programming, always having goal in my mind - creating useful, intuitive programs which could improve and make life easier. I am looking for my first experience in the IT industry to improve my skills in building applications, both architecturally and scripting.
