# Hi! I'm Krzysztof, an Junior C#/.NET Software Engineer 👨‍💻
![C# NET Software Engineer-min](https://github.com/PoProstuKrzysztof/PoProstuKrzysztof/assets/92109319/460beaa0-24b3-4bf1-ae24-4c0f19688071)

 I'm Christopher, and I started my journey with programming since I enrolled on my unversity. 

It was challenging at first, but I eventually realized that everything is possible with dedicated effort and discipline, which is especially important with coding. This had a good impact on several aspects of my life, not just my software development abilities.

My spare time is filled with programming, always having goal in my mind - creating useful, intuitive programs which could improve and make life easier.

I am looking for my first experience in the IT industry to improve my skills in building applications, both architecturally and scripting.
